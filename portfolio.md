# Rumors handbook

I worked for three years in a small, interdisciplinary design studio, where one of my roles was to help tighten up workflow practices. After awhile, I started agitating for more agile practices, and worked with my colleagues to refine our methodology and provide better service to our clients and more sanity in our day-to-day operations. As we settled into our routines, I began to write an open source handbook hosted in a GitHub repo. We hoped it would document and codify studio practices, improve new employee onboarding, and help to set client expectations. The handbook was meant to be a "living document" -- in other words, it's incomplete. Rumors is on hiatus as of June of 2019.

# Sister City

Rumors was contracted by the Ace hotels team to design and build a custom platform connecting multiple hospitality software services and a new website for a New York "lean luxe" hotel. We provided content strategy, UX design, front-end, back-end, and API design services. It was a complex piece of software, with a deep set of features: a hotel room availability calendar matrix, user accounts, a dashboard for service requests and reservation management, and the usual photo galleries and text content. (This somehow makes it sound simpler than it was!)

One the many exciting challenges of the project was how to account for publishing and editing site content. The slim budget left no room for a CMS, but there was plenty of content to manage. We needed a simple way for the relatively non-technical Ace marketing staff to update words that a website user would encounter -- the brand had a very clear voice, and a bad error message could ruin a customer's experience. I collaborated with the API engineer, back-end developer, and designer to create a solution: the site's administrators could edit most text in a Markdown or YAML file in a GitHub repository, and our Vue-based system would grab the content as needed. I also provided training and a content guide to help orient new editors.

Before all this, I worked in tandem with our designer to create empathy maps and personas, which we used to guide user journey design, information design, content strategy, and feature development.

# H2O

H2O is a platform for creating, sharing and remixing open course materials, created by the Library Innovation Lab at the Harvard Law School Library. The goal of this project was to create a static prototype that demonstrated a compelling vision of H2O. How might the tool work best to serve students and professors of law? Which elements are used most? What functionalities might we introduce or remove to enhance the user experience? Along with the static prototype files, I delivered

# The Nuremberg Project

The Harvard Law School Library’s Nuremberg Project is an open-access initiative to create and present digitized images or full-text versions of the Library’s complete set of Nuremberg documents, descriptions of each document, and general information about the trials.

The original website, launched in the early 2000s, was showing its age. The goal of this project was to create a prototype and new vision for the site that encompassed the full spectrum of the collection — over a million pages — and related the transcripts and documents in an engaging, accessible way for scholars and an intelligent public audience. Specifically, I sought to provide better transcript and document navigation and a simplified and robust search. The prototype grants users access to documents in a coherent way, with a model for location and discovery, and showcases the collection — the extent, scope, and importance to world heritage. It is also meant to attract donations for its further development.

Meeting with the HLS staff was a real treat — to be surrounded by such intelligence and commitment is inspiring. Our discussions yielded a complete overhaul of the site’s content strategy, presenting the keyword search as the primary site action, and introducing the idea of editorialized “approaches” to the collection, inviting exploration and discovery by surfacing popular searches, like a defendant or prosecutor’s name, or trial keywords and topics, like euthanasia or war crimes.

I created a suite of wireframes with increasing levels of fidelity, before building a static prototype using Sketch and InVision. Along with the prototype, I also provided a series of support documentation for the site’s strategy and design beyond the prototype phase: a creative brief to help guide further design direction; a style guide covering specific site design choices and interface elements that effectively and appropriately convey information about the depth and complexity of the trials; and a content strategy brief and direct revisions to the site’s existing text.

The visual tone was loosely inspired by an afternoon visit to the small New England Holocaust Memorial park in downtown Boston. To communicate a somber yet inviting tone, I chose colors lifted from the park and from other organic materials — cool, organic neutrals, like slate, black granite, quartzite, concrete, along with complementary wooly grays and sandy beiges. Tiempos Text, the serif face widely used in running text, is neutral and approachable and comes in a variety of weights and styles which makes it easy to use across a few different applications. The sans-serif is Proof, whose subtle digital feeling seemed perfect for the presentation of metadata and forms. Plus, its name — Proof — seemed apt for a collection of documents about an event that continues to require vigilant remembrance.

# “Alive and Well”
## design research

Williams College was creating a new environmental center that aimed to achieve Living Building certification. The college wanted to gather data on the building’s energy use and communicate that data in a dynamic and compelling way to the building’s occupants and other people and institutions. But how? Williams invited me to consult on the design process for this yet-to-be-created tool. My goal was to help determine the project audience and recommend potential solutions. Who is interested in this building’s energy use? How might they engage with this information? How could we foster meaningful, interactive experiences?

Over the course of two months, I worked with project stakeholders and potential users, including faculty, staff, students, and members of the community, to understand the project context and articulate and prioritize specific project goals. I facilitated two one-hour meetings with the stakeholder team and conducted over twenty hourlong exploratory interviews with potential users across a targeted cross-section of of the Williams community.

Throughout the design research process, the team referred to the outcome of the project as “the tool.” During the course of our meetings and interviews, it quickly became clear that the tool wasn’t any one thing, but a number of interrelated technologies and approaches. At the end of the project, I delivered a report synthesizing and outlining what we worked together to create — describing the specific project goals, audiences, and potential features — and a recommended path forward that was sensitive to the college’s time and resources.

# n+1
## website

n+1 print magazine is designed by my husband Dan, so we were both thrilled when the team there approached us for a second time — the first was in 2009 — to redesign the website. This time around, our goals were to completely revamp the online strategy and update the visual design.

n+1 is an organization — a foundation, a collective — with a magazine at its center, and from which other projects and publications emerge. The old website sidelined the group’s projects and publications, and privileged the non-subscriber by offering meticulously crafted content for free. With the redesign, we reconfigured the site as a subscription-based platform, establishing a content hierarchy that highlights subscriptions and books, and making a clear distinction between these and other web-only content. Visually, the site continues to reflect the design sensibility of the print magazine, recontextualized as a responsive, device-agnostic digital platform.
