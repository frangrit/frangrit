## üìì Rumors handbook

I worked for three years at [Rumors](http://rumo.rs), a small interdisciplinary design studio, in a hybrid strategist and producer role. One of my jobs was to propose and guide refinements to our methodology so we could provide better service to our clients and more sanity in our day-to-day operations. After assessing the state of the studio with employee and client interviews, I guided the adoption of more agile practices. Over time, as we settled on rituals, software, and artifacts that worked for us, I wrote an [open source handbook](https://github.com/rumors/handbook) inspired by [Thoughtbot](https://thoughtbot.com/) and [18F](https://18f.gsa.gov/). It documented and codified studio practices, improved new employee onboarding, and helped to set client expectations. The handbook was meant to be a living document -- in other words, it's incomplete. Rumors is on hiatus as of June 2019.

## üîµ Sister City

The Ace hotels team contracted Rumors to develop a web-based tool for their new "lean luxe" hotel in New York City. Working closely with Ace engineers, we built a platform that connects multiple hospitality software services behind the facade of an elegantly simple website. We provided content strategy, UX design, front-end, back-end, and API design services. It was a complex piece of software, with a deep set of features: a hotel room availability calendar matrix, user accounts, a service requests dashboard, reservation management, and the usual photo galleries and text content. (This somehow makes it sound simpler than it was!)

One the many challenges of the project was how to account for publishing and editing site content. The slim budget left no room for a CMS, but there was plenty of content to manage. We needed a simple way for the relatively non-technical Ace writers to update words that a website user would encounter -- the brand had a very clear voice, and the wrong word could ruin a customer's experience. I collaborated with the API engineer, back-end developer, and designer to create a solution: the site's administrators could edit most text in a Markdown or YAML file in a GitHub repository, and our Vue-based system would grab the content as needed. I also provided training and a [content guide](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Website-content-guide-Sister-City--Aha1~AnMeVAhKFLkVFFhomVvAg-xQEXYYZKVgvRa0oiVgdxp) to help orient new editors.

Before all this, I worked in tandem with our designer to create empathy maps and personas, which we used to guide content strategy, feature development, and UX design.

## üí£ BOMB

While at Rumors, I served as lead strategist on a website redesign for BOMB, a 30-year-old arts magazine based in New York. BOMB's new site strategy was focused on three goals: to facilitate lateral browsing, discovery, and research; to expand readership; and as much as possible, to future-proof content and technology. To that end, I proposed a full content restructure, focusing on structured content, standardized taxonomies and language, and content relationships that flattened the site hierarchy. The back-end content model served editorial purposes and made it easier for administrators to create platform agnostic structured content. On the front-end, navigable category types (based on subject medium and article format) acted in service of the content, subtly framing BOMB‚Äôs articles and providing high-level context to website visitors. Working with the digital editor, I created a controlled vocabulary for tags to better surface archival content, and supplied new tools in the CMS to allow for editorial groupings outside the standard print magazine and online-only hierarchies.

## ‚öñÔ∏è H2O

[H2O](https://opencasebook.org/) is a platform for creating, sharing, and remixing open course materials, created by the [Library Innovation Lab](https://lil.law.harvard.edu/) (LIL) at the Harvard Law School. The goal of this project was to create a static prototype demonstrating a compelling vision of H2O. How might it best serve students and professors of law? Which elements are used most? What functionalities might we introduce or remove to enhance the user experience? I started with an audit the software from a UX perspective. But I wasn't the core user -- so I also conduced interviews with professors, students, and the engineers maintaining the software; LIL provided their own detailed user feedback for analysis. Working closely with with designer [Dan O. Williams](https://thisisdano.github.io/) (he's also my husband), I came at solutions from two angles: creation and consumption. The users creating casebooks were an entirely different kind, with different technical facilities, than the ones reading and studying the casebooks. We created a suite of prototype wireframes, plus fully designed screens for several key components, flows, and actions. Along with these design files, we delivered a project brief covering design principles, attributes, and an overall strategy for framing solutions.

## üìú The Nuremberg Project

[LIL](https://lil.law.harvard.edu/)‚Äôs [Nuremberg Project](http://nuremberg.law.harvard.edu/) is an initiative to provide open access to the Library‚Äôs complete set of Nuremberg documents and information about the trials. The goal of this project was to represent the full spectrum of the collection ‚Äî over a million pages ‚Äî and relate the transcripts and documents in an engaging, accessible way for scholars and an intelligent public audience. The prototype I created provides better transcript and document navigation and a simplified, robust search. It grants users access to documents in a coherent way, with a model for location and discovery, and showcases the collection ‚Äî its extent, scope, and importance to world heritage. It is also meant to attract donations for its further development.

Workshops and discussions with LIL yielded a complete overhaul of the site‚Äôs content strategy, presenting keyword search as the primary site action, and introducing the idea of editorialized ‚Äúapproaches‚Äù to the collection, inviting exploration and discovery by surfacing popular searches, like a defendant or prosecutor‚Äôs name, or trial keywords and topics, like *euthanasia* or *war crimes*.

I created a suite of wireframes with increasing levels of fidelity, before building a static prototype using Sketch and InVision. Along with the prototype, I also provided a series of support documentation for the site‚Äôs strategy and design beyond the prototype phase: a creative brief to help guide further design direction; a style guide covering specific site design choices and interface elements that effectively and appropriately convey information about the depth and complexity of the trials; and a content strategy brief and extensive revisions to the site‚Äôs existing text.

## üìä ‚ÄúAlive and Well‚Äù

Williams College was creating a new environmental center that aimed to achieve Living Building certification. The college wanted to gather data on the building‚Äôs energy use and communicate that data in a dynamic and compelling way to the building‚Äôs occupants and other people and institutions. But how? Williams invited me to consult on the design process for this yet-to-be-created tool. My goal was to help determine the project audience and recommend potential solutions. Who is interested in this building‚Äôs energy use? How might they engage with this information? How could we foster meaningful, interactive experiences?

Over the course of two months, I worked with project stakeholders and potential users, including faculty, staff, students, and members of the community, to understand the project context and articulate and prioritize specific project goals. I facilitated two one-hour meetings with the stakeholder team and conducted over twenty hourlong exploratory interviews with potential users across a targeted cross-section of of the Williams community.

Throughout the design research process, the team referred to the outcome of the project as ‚Äúthe tool.‚Äù During the course of our meetings and interviews, it quickly became clear that the tool wasn‚Äôt any one thing, but a number of interrelated technologies and approaches. At the end of the project, I delivered a report synthesizing and outlining what we worked together to create ‚Äî describing the specific project goals, audiences, and potential features ‚Äî and a recommended path forward that was sensitive to the college‚Äôs time and resources.

## ‚ûï n+1

n+1 is an organization with a magazine at its center, from which other projects and publications emerge. The website sidelined the group‚Äôs projects and publications, and privileged the non-subscriber by offering over ten years of meticulously crafted content for free. I worked with n+1‚Äôs designer, Dan O. Williams (yes, my husband), to completely revamp the site strategy and update the visual design. We reconfigured the site as a subscription based, paywalled platform, establishing a content hierarchy that highlights magazine subscriptions and books, with a clear distinction between these and other content. Visually, the site continues to reflect the design sensibility of the print magazine, recontextualized as a responsive, device-agnostic digital platform.
